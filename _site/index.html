      <p>Plant personality is an interactive educational curriculum for High School students. It consists of an introduction to sensors, data collection, microbits, ChatGPT, Sentiment Analysis, and social robotics.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/logo.jpg" alt="MainImage" /></p>

<p>Plant Personality has four main parts/sections :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Construction</strong> : Students explore how to activate their microbits and connect them to plant sensors and a plant analysis app. This introduces students to hardware skills, logic, and data processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Programming/GPT Connestion</strong> : Students discover how to program the app to take in sensor data and send it through ChatGPT . Students gain App Inventor programming skills. Students also find out how OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT works.</li>
  <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong> : Students discuss sentiment analysis and its use cases, and connect it to the output of the previous lesson. Students will also broaden their App Inventor programming skills by assigning the micro:bit different faces depending on recieved sentiment score.</li>
  <li><strong>Sociable Technology</strong> : Students create basic code for technology that interacts socially with humans. Students discuss how a social interface compares to normal data collection or graphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you can also refer to our <a href="./projects.html">projects gallery</a> for previous projects, and <a href="./resources.html">resources</a> to download model files and source code.</p>

<p>This project is developed and maintained by MIT. (app inventor, csail?, raise?, media lab, personal robots group)</p>
