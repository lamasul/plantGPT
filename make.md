# Setting up the Microbit and MIT App Inventor
Prepare the Microbits to collect data and give your plant a personality.

You can assemble your Microbit and sensor in just a few steps. 

## 1. Setting up the Microbit
* 1. Get the Microbit Code. 
The Microbit needs code to activate sensors and send data to student apps.
 Go to:  https://makecode.microbit.org/S97971-17452-78128-79842
 * Click the button Edit Code in the top right corner:
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/editMicrobit.png" title="Image 1">
 
 * You should see the following page:
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/MicrobitCode.png" title="Image 2">
 
 * Decide whether you should log into Microbit.org (top right). If you do not log in, the code will always be saved on the computer you are using. If you log in, the code will be saved to an online account you can use on any computer. 

 * Briefly check out the Microbit code used for this lesson. This code will collect temperature, humidity, and moisture data with the external sensor. The Microbit will send data to the phone app every 2 seconds over Bluetooth.  

 * 2. Connect the Microbit to the USB cable
Connect the Microbit and your computer to the black USB cable with the device (or use any typical Micro-USB cable you have available). 
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/ConnectMicrobit.png" title="Image 3">

* The Microbit should light up!
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/LightMicrobit.png" title="Image 4">

* 3. Download the code to the Microbit
* Click on the three dots as shown.
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/code1.png" title="Image 5">

* Choose Connect Device and follow the directions on the screen to connect the Microbit to the computer. (The Microbit will automatically connect to this computer from now on.)
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/code2.png" title="Image 6">

* Click Download. 
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/code3.png" title="Image 7">

You may see a computer notification, “Disk not ejected properly!” You can safely ignore this warning.
Troubleshooting: If the Microbit does not download, follow the instructions provided on your screen or the tips in Appendix B. Don’t worry — the solution is not complicated! 

* After about a minute, you should see a graphic of a little sleeping guy on the LED display. Success! 
<img align="center" width="450" height="450" src="./images/connected.png" title="Image 8">
 
* From now on, this microbit will always hold onto your new code, even when unplugged.

## 2. Test Firmware

Before we get too far into construction, lets load the test firmware on to the microcontroller. The test program just draws for boxes so we can check for proper direction and dimension.

1. Download the Arduino software from www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. Open the Arduino software.
3. Download the attached zip file and unzip it to the Arduino sketchbook location.
* You can find (or change) this location in the Arduino IDE: [File] -> [Preferences]-> "Sketchbook Location".
4. Load the test sketch: [File] -> [Sketchbook] -> [TIRL_Arduino_TEST]
5. Attach your Arduino to your computer with a USB cable.
6. In the Arduino IDE:
  * Set you board type: [Tools] -> [Board] -> Your board type.
  * Set your serial port: [Tools] -> [Port] -> Usually the last one listed.
7. Upload the sketch using the arrow icon.

If you have any problems, refer to www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting for help.

## 3. Pen Holder and Battery Holders

<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step3_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step3_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step3_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step3_img4.jpg" title="Image 4">

1. Insert the nuts on the top side of the chassis (Image 1). You may have to press them in.
2. Install the Pen Holder with the Servo Bracket on the top side of the chassis (Image 2 & 3). 
3. Attach the battery holders on the bottom of the chassis using 3Mx6mm flat-head screws (Image 4)
  * You need at least 5xAA to properly power an Arduino via its onboard regulartor. Six would work as well. 
  * You want the weight shifted toward the caster, so put the 3xAA towards the back. 
  * Orient the holders so the leads are closest to the rectangular cable runs. 
4. Thread the battery leads through the rectangular cable runs (Image 4). 
5. Repeat for the other battery holder. 
**Note:** Unless specified, the remainder of the screws are 3Mx8mm pan head screws.

## Step 4. Stepper Brackets


<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step4_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step4_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step4_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step4_img4.jpg" title="Image 4">

1. Insert a nut into the stepper bracket and attach them to the top of the chassis with a screw (Image 1).
2. Insert the stepper into the bracket and attach with screws and nuts.
3. Repeat for the other bracket.

## Step 5. Caster

<img align="left" width="220" height="220" src="./images/step5_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="center" width="220" height="220" src="./images/step5_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">

1. Insert the ball bearing into the caster. 
  * Do not force it in or it will break. Use a hair-drier or hot air gun to soften the material if needed.
2. Attach the caster to the bottom side of the chassis in front of the battery holder.
**Note:** If you need a different diameter, you can edit the openScad file (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1052674) to fit what ever you have on hand.

## Step 6. Breadboard and Brains

<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step6_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step6_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step6_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="left" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step6_img4.jpg" title="Image 4">
<img align="center" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step6_img5.jpg" title="Image 5">

1. Remove one of the power rails using a sharp knife, cutting through the bottom adhesive (Image 1).
  * One rail has power (red) on outer edge, they other negative (blue). I'm keeping the first attached, and it will match the schematics and photos. If you use the other, just adjust the wires accordingly.
2. Holding the breadboard over the chassis rails, mark where they intersect the edge (Image 2).
3. Using a straight edge (like the removed power rail), mark the lines and cut through the backing (Image 3).
4. Place the breadboard on the chassis with the rails touching the exposed adhesive (Image 4).
5. Attach the Arduino to the other side of the chassis using 4-20 screws (Image 5).

## Step 7. Capacitor and Part Placement

<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step7_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step7_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step7_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step7_img4.jpg" title="Image 4"><br/><br/><br/><br/>

1. Place the darlington driver and power switch on to the bread board (Image 1).
  * I've added orange dots for visibility to mark the following:
    * Pin 1 of the darlington driver
    * The battery pin of the microtroller.The power switch "on" position.
2. Trim the capacitor leads if necessary (longer is negative) (Image 2).
3. Insert the capacitor into the correct rails on the top of the breadboard (Image 3).

## Step 8. Power


<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step8_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step8_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step8_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step8_img4.jpg" title="Image 4">
<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step8_img5.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step8_img6.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step8_img7.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step8_img8.jpg" title="Image 4"><br/><br/><br/><br/>

1. With the right-hand battery leads:Connect the red line to the first pin of the power switch (Image 1).
2. Connect the black lead to an empty row between the microcontroller and the darlington chip (Image 1).
3. With the left-hand battery leads:Connect the red line to the same row as the black lead of the other battery (Image 2).
4. Connect the black line to the negative rail of the breadboard (Image 2).
5. Connect power to the microcontroller:
  1. Red jumper from positive rail to the battery pin (orange dot, Image 3).
  2. Black jumper from the negative rail to the pin marked "G" (Image 4).
6. Install batteries and switch the power on (Image 5).
7. You should see the green and red lights of the controller come on (Image 6).

**Troubleshooting:**
  * If the microcontroller lights do not come on, **immediately** turn the power off and troubleshoot:
    * Batteries installed in the correct orientation?
    * Double check battery leads positioning.
    * Double check switch leads positioning.
    * Use a multi-meter to check voltages of batteries.
    * Use multi-meter to check power rail voltages.
    
## Step 9. Stepper Power

<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step8_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="225" height="225" src="./images/step8_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="225" height="225" src="./images/step8_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">

Now that you've got power to the microcontroller, let's finish wiring power to the steppers:

1. Connect a black jumper from the upper left darlington pin to the negative side of the power rail (Image 1).
2. Connect a red jumper from the lower left darlington pin to the positive side of the power rail (Image
3. Connect a red jumper from the lower left darlington pin to one row right of the darlington (Image 2).
4. Insert pin headers for the stepper's white JST connectors (Image 2).

## Step 10. Stepper Control Signals

<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step10_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step10_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step10_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="left" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step10_img4.jpg" title="Image 4">
<img align="center" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step10_img5.jpg" title="Image 5">

The microcontroller provides 5 volt signals to the darlington array which in turn, provides VCC to the stepper coils:

1. Start with pin next to the ground pin on the darlington driver, and install orange, yellow, green, and blue wires in that order (Image 1).
2. Attach the jumpers to the following arduino pins (Image 2):
  * 1. orange - Digital pin 4
  * 2. yellow - Digital pin 5
  * 3. green - Digital pin 6
  * 4. blue - Digital pin 7
3. Back at the darlington, continue jumper for the other stepper in the reverse of the others:
  * blue, green, yellow, and orange (Image 3).
4. Attach the jumpers to the following arduino pins (Image 4):
  * 1. blue - Digital pin 9 (pin 8 used latter for the servo).
  * 2. green - Digital pin 10
  * 3. yellow - Digital pin 11
  * 4. orange - Digital pin 12
  
  ## Step 11: Stepper Coil Connections
  
<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step11_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="225" height="225" src="./images/step11_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="225" height="225" src="./images/step11_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
  
 The stepper's white JST connectors attach to the pin header. The red lead is power, and should match the red power jumpers we installed earlier (Image 1).

All colors should match the microcontroller jumpers on the opposite side of the darlington, with the exception of green, which matches the pink wire of the stepper (Image 2).

## Step 12: Servo

<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step12_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step12_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step12_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="left" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step12_img4.jpg" title="Image 4">
<img align="center" width="250" height="250" src="./images/step12_img5.jpg" title="Image 5">

1. Install the servo horn with the servo rotated clockwise to the stop and the horn horizontal (Image 1).
2. Attach the servo to the holder, and the horn pointed to the right stepper side (Image 1).
3. Attach brown (ground), red (5V power), and white (signal) jumpers into the servo connector, matching the servo wire colors (Image 2).
4. Attach the power and ground jumpers to the ground and 5V header on the Arduino (Image 3).
5. Connect the white signal wire to the Arduino's Digital Pin 8 (Image 4).

## Step 13: Wheels

<img align="left" width="220" height="220" src="./images/step13_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="center" width="220" height="220" src="./images/step13_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">

1. Place the rubber o-ring around the edge of the wheel (Image 1).
2. If the fit of the hub on the axle is loose, you can use a 3M screw to hold it in place (Image 2).
  * Do not tighten it too much or you will strip the plastic.
  
## Step 14: Testing

Hopefully you already uploaded the firmware in Step 2. If not, do it now.

The test firmware just draws a square repeatedly so we can check direction and accuracy.

1. Place your robot on a smooth, flat, open surface.
2. Turn the power on.
3. Watch your robot draw squares.
If you are not seeing lights on the microcontroller, go back and troublshoot power as in Step 8.

If your robot is not moving, double check the power connections to the darlington driver in Step 9.

If your robot is moving erratically, double check the pin connections for the microcontroller and darlington driver in Step 10.

## Step 15: Calibration 

<img align="left" width="450" height="450" src="./images/step15_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step15_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step15_img3.jpg" title="Image 3">
<img align="center" width="150" height="150" src="./images/step15_img4.jpg" title="Image 4">

If your robot is moving in an approximate square, it is time to put some paper down and put a pen in it.

Measure your wheel diameter (Image 1) and wheel base (Image 2) in millimeters.

Your calibration settings in the code are:
```
float wheel_dia=63;     // mm (increase = spiral out)
float wheel_base=109;   // mm (increase = spiral in)
int steps_rev=128;      // 128 for 16x gearbox, 512 for 64x gearbox
```
I started with a measured wheel diameter of 65 mm and you can see the boxes rotating outward or clockwise each step (Image 3).

I eventually arrived at a value of 63mm (Image 4). You can see that there is still some inherent error due to gear lash and such. Close enough to do something interesting!

## Step 16: Raising and Lowering the Pen

<img align="left" width="220" height="220" src="./images/step16_img1.jpg" title="Image 1">
<img align="center" width="220" height="220" src="./images/step16_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">

We've added a servo, but haven't done anything with it. It allows you to raise and lower the pen so the robot can move without drawing.

1. Place the pen collar on the pen (Image 1).
  * If it is loose, tape it in place.
2. Check that it will touch the paper when the servo arm is lowered.
3. Check that it will not touch the paper when raised.

The servo angles can be adjusted either by removing the horn and re-positioning it, or through the software:
```
int PEN_DOWN = 20; // angle of servo when pen is down
int PEN_UP = 80;   // angle of servo when pen is up
```

The pen commands are:
```
penup(); 
pendown();
```
If you want to use different pen sizes, you will have to modify the pen holder (www.thingiverse.com/thing:1052725) and pen collar (www.thingiverse.com/thing:1053273) with the correct diameter.

## Step 17: Have Fun!

Now it is time to explore. If you look at the test sketch, you will see I have provided you some standard "Turtle" commands:

```
forward(distance);   // millimeters
backward(distance);
left(angle);         // degrees
right(angle);
penup();
pendown();
done();              // release stepper to save battery
```

Using these commands, you should be able to do just about anything, from drawing snow flakes or writing your name. If you need some help getting started, click on the videos below!

The Solution using Standard Markdown ( not iFrame! )
Using an iframe is not the "obvious" solution... especially if the Markdown parser (or publishing platform) you are using does not support inlining content from a different website ... Instead you can "fake it" by including a valid linked-image in your Markdown file, using this format:

<img align="center" width="220" height="220" src="./images/step18_img2.jpg" title="Image 2">

*Could this robot be done with a -Insert your favorite board here-?*

Yes! This platform is very flexible. You would mainly just need to modify the chassis.

Above, you can see the robot made with a Raspberry Pi (Image 1) and an Adafruit Trinket (www.instructables.com/id/Low-Cost-Arduino-Compatible-Drawing-Robot/) (Image 2).
