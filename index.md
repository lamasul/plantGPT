Plant personality is an interactive educational curriculum for High School students. It consists of an introduction to sensors, data collection, microbits, ChatGPT, Sentiment Analysis, and social robotics.

Plant Personality has four main parts/sections : 

* **Construction** : Students explore how to activate their microbits and connect them to plant sensors and a plant analysis app. This introduces students to hardware skills, logic, and data processing. 
* **Programming/GPT Connestion** : Students discover how to program the app to take in sensor data and send it through ChatGPT . Students gain App Inventor programming skills. Students also find out how OpenAI's ChatGPT works. 
* **Sociable Technology** : Students create basic code for technology that interacts socially with humans. Students discuss how a social interface compares to normal data collection or graphs. 

In addition, you can also refer to our [projects gallery](./projects.html) for previous projects, and [resources](./resources.html) to find links to the App Inventor Code and more project resources. 

This project is developed and maintained in collaboration among Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media lab and App Inventor.
